# Notes, Ideas and Thoughts

## To do
1. Bee
* Ran bee gmap and gsnap (job 136483). Job completed ok, I think... I noticed there was no R2 fasta file for bee sequences... did I miss them when uploading fasta files to Atlas?

2. Maize
* Ran maize gsnap, samtools (job 136482). Saw maize bam file empty... it is still running so might take some time.
