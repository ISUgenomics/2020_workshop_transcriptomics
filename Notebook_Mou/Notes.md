# Notes, Ideas and Thoughts

## To do
1. Bee
* Toss out the one sample and run deseq2, see how that looks in R script QC section
* Run PCA of only diff expressed genes to get better clustering (if only a few genes diff. expressed, would not see clear clusters - get the scatter that Rick saw)
* Look through gff file for annotation of gene locus names: https://github.com/ISUgenomics/2021_workshop_transcriptomics/blob/main/Notebook_Masonbrink/02_Bumblebee/07_FeatureTable.md

2. Maize
* Run PCA of only diff expressed genes to get better clustering (if only a few genes diff. expressed, would not see clear clusters - get the scatter that Rick saw)

3. PCIT articles:
