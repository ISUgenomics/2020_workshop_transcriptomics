# Notes, Ideas and Thoughts

## To do
1. Bee
* Run multiQC on `*txt.summary` files
* Run combine.R

2. Maize
* Run multiQC on fastq files -- Issues with installing multiQC on atlas with miniconda. Will reach out to vsrc.
* Reran gsnap + featurecounts (job 154052) - how does output look? Run multiQC on `*txt.summary` files. Run combine.R

3. Read MultiQC to assess read alignment (can try this on gsnap output): http://www.bea.ki.se/documents/Intro2RNAseq.pdf

4. What parameter to use in gsnap to remove bad reads? (unassigned: unmapped, ambiguous, multimapping, no features)
