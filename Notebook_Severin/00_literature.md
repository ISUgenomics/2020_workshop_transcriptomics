### [A comprehensive examination of Nanopore native RNA sequencing for characterization of complex transcriptomes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11272-z)
A platform for highly parallel direct sequencing of native RNA strands was recently described by Oxford Nanopore Technologies, but despite initial efforts it remains crucial to further investigate the technology for quantification of complex transcriptomes. Here we undertake native RNA sequencing of polyA + RNA from two human cell lines, analysing ~5.2 million aligned native RNA reads. To enable informative comparisons, we also perform relevant ONT direct cDNA- and Illumina-sequencing. We find that while native RNA sequencing does enable some of the anticipated advantages, key unexpected aspects currently hamper its performance, most notably the quite frequent inability to obtain full-length transcripts from single reads, as well as difficulties to unambiguously infer their true transcript of origin. While characterising issues that need to be addressed when investigating more complex transcriptomes, our study highlights that with some defined improvements, native RNA sequencing could be an important addition to the mammalian transcriptomics toolbox.


### [Transcriptome variation in human tissues revealed by long-read sequencing](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.22.427687v1)

Regulation of transcript structure generates transcript diversity and plays an important role in human disease. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies offers the opportunity to study the role of genetic variation in transcript structure. In this paper, we present a large human long-read RNA-seq dataset using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform from 88 samples from GTEx tissues and cell lines, complementing the GTEx resource. We identified just under 100,000 new transcripts for annotated genes, and validated the protein expression of a similar proportion of novel and annotated transcripts. We developed a new computational package, LORALS, to analyze genetic effects of rare and common variants on the transcriptome via allele-specific analysis of long reads. We called allele-specific expression and transcript structure events, providing novel insights into the specific transcript alterations caused by common and rare genetic variants and highlighting the resolution gained from long-read data. We were able to perturb transcript structure upon knockdown of PTBP1, an RNA binding protein that mediates splicing, thereby finding genetic regulatory effects that are modified by the cellular environment. Finally, we use this dataset to enhance variant interpretation and study rare variants leading to aberrant splicing patterns.
